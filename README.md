# SCREL's Flutter Machine Test

## Task: Designing a User Listing Application

Create an application that lists 10 users retrieved from the provided API, along with a search bar at the top of the screen. When you tap on any user's tile, open a detailed page/screen displaying all the user data from the API. Additionally, include an option to view the user's location on a map, which will be provided through latitude (lat) and longitude (lng) values in the API.

## Requirements:

- Utilize the **Provider** & **Freezed** package.
- Ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing user interface and user experience (UI/UX).
- Allow users to star/unstar each user from the list.
- Implement actions for data from the API, such as opening a link when tapping on a website link.


### To begin, follow these steps:

1. Start by creating a Flutter project.
2. Once your task is finished, upload all your code to your GitHub account with appropriate commit messages.
3. Make sure your repository is public.
4. Share the project's GitHub link with us.





## NOTE:

UI & UX, code reusability, code readability, file structure, architecture, etc., will be used for evaluation.
